\opening{Hello,}

My name is Fletcher Porter.  I'm an early-career engineer and I'm interested in your Software Engineer position.

In the past months since the quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic began, I've been working with a non-profit team called Tetra Bio Distributed to develop a ventilator splitter to help make hospitals' responses to spikes in infection more easily scalable.  My role has been developing the software system, which includes writing drivers for pressure and flow sensors, writing a system to collect the data and convert it into useful patient breathing descriptors, a browser-based front end, a bridge connecting the descriptors to the front end, and a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) system to run unit tests to validate that the software works.  I used the tools Python, Docker, Raspberry Pi Linux, Golang, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Git, and GitHub actions for this.

Prior to that, I have done substantial research in engineering labs at UCSB and at internships with the Robotics Vehicles and Manipulators group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  My work spanned design, controls, autonomy, mechatronics, modeling, and programming.

In summer 2018, I did an internship at JPL.  My project was a gravity-offload system that I completed in summer 2018, where a spring offloads the weight of a robot to simulate the gravity on Saturn's moon Enceladus and a motion control system that I made moves the spring to track the motion of the robot.  I did all the mechanical design in this project and created fabrication specifications that I sent to a vendor.

As you'll read in my resume, I'd be a great fit for the Software Engineer position.  My experience in interdisciplinary project, having worked on mechanical, electrical, control, and software systems in different projects, is invaluable in robotics work.  The execution of every task is enhanced by having a broad understanding of how different disciplines work.  For my experience level I am unique for my large breadth of hardware knowledge, while still having strong software skills.

I also have strong communication skills which I've practiced in formal presentations, reports, and papers for the work I have done, a few of which are available to view in my portfolio, available at http://fletcherporter.com/.

Thank you for your consideration.  I hope to hear from you soon.


\closing{Cheers,}
