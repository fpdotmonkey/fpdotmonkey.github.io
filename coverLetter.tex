\opening{Hello,}

My name is Fletcher Porter.  I'm an early-career Mechanical Engineer and I'm interested in your Mechatronics Test Engineer position.

In the past months since the quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic began, I've been working with a non-profit team called Tetra Bio Distributed to develop a ventilator splitter to help make hospitals' responses to spikes in infection more easily scalable.  My role has been developing the software system, which includes writing drivers for pressure and flow sensors, writing a system to collect the data and convert it into useful patient breathing descriptors, a browser-based front end, a bridge connecting the descriptors to the front end, and a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment system to run tests to validate that the software works.  I used the tools Python, Docker, Golang, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Git, and GitHub actions for this.

Prior to that, I have done substantial research in engineering labs at UCSB and at internships with the Robotics Vehicles and Manipulators group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  My work has spanned design, controls, autonomy, mechatronics, modeling, and programming.

As you'll read in my resume, I'd be a great fit for the Mechatronics Test Engineer position.  My broad skill set lends itself to troubleshooting complex mechatronical systems and developing novel robotic devices.  I do my best work when I am involved in many aspects of a project, but am focusing on only one or two sections so I can have an understanding of the entire system.

I worked on a project at JPL with some of the same people that worked with ATK on the Curiosity robot arm.  My project was a gravity-offload system that I completed in summer 2018, where a spring offloads the weight of a robot to simulate the gravity on Saturn's moon Enceladus and a motion control system that I made moves the spring to track the motion of the robot.  I did all the mechanical design in this project and created fabrication specifications that I sent to a vendor.

I also have strong communication skills which I've practiced in formal presentations, reports, and papers for the work I have done, a few of which are available to view in my portfolio, available at http://fletcherporter.com/.

Thank you for your consideration.  I hope to hear from you soon.


\closing{Cheers,}
