\begin{letter}{Some Company}

\opening{Hello,}

My name is Fletcher Porter.  I'm a masters student studying mechanical
engineering at Aalto University and I'm interested in working in your Summer
Power: Engineering \& Technology program.

I'm presently studying with a focus on mechatronics and robotics.  I enjoy
these fields for their interdisciplinary nature where I can touch a little of
everything in an engineering system--the mechanical, the software, and the
electrical.

Before coming to Aalto, I was a software developer for a company called Oblong
making meeting software.  My job was to improve the company's legacy products
which entailed using a variety of software tools and languages, including
Python, Linux, C++, JavaScript, and many others.  The software I wrote was
deployed to hundreds of sites around the world.  However, I found only writing
software dissatisfying.  I yearned to do what I did at NASA Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

At JPL I worked on a gravity-offload testbed for studying robotic mobility for
future missions to Saturn's moon Enceladus.  It consisted of a robot suspended
by a gravity-offloading spring from a gantry system that automatically tracked
the position of the robot.  I developed the mechanical, electrical, and control
components of this gantry, including a camera-based vision system, power
routing, and the design, fabrication, and assembly of all components.

I'm seeking now to work someplace where I can hone my skills as an engineer and
gain experience working on multi-disciplinary projects.  I see myself being a
unique contributor to engineering teams as a mechanical engineer who knows
software.

Thank you for your consideration.  I hope to hear from you soon.


\closing{Cheers,}

\end{letter}
